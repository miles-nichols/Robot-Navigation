   Led the design and development of a microcontroller-based robot
                capable of autonomously navigating a predefined, unknown course.
                Managed a team of six by streamlining collaboration through clear
                task delegation, regular meetings, and consistent communication.
                Designed and implemented control algorithms in C to process data
                from integrated sensorsâ€”including ADCs, ultrasonic distance
                sensors (ping), and servos to accurate movement and real-time
                obstacle avoidance. To support development and debugging, built a
                custom Python-based GUI that visualized sensor data and provided
                live system feedback.
